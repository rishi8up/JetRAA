EPS09.f is the Fortran file which reads data for $R[pPb]=\phi(x,
pT)_{Pb}/\phi(x, pT)_{p}$ from "EPS09LO" or "EPS09NLO" and outputs
R[pPb] as a function of x.

Presently we output the results in the following tabulated format.

pT, x=2*pT/\sqrt{S}, R_g[pPb] (ratio of gluonic PDFs), $\Delta$ R_g[pPb] (error)

To compile use 
$. ./Makefile

To run use
$./EPS09.out > RgPbEPS09.dat
